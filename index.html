    <p>KFC was one of the first American fast-food chains to expand internationally, opening outlets in Canada, the
        United Kingdom, Mexico and Jamaica by the mid-1960s. Throughout the 1970s and 1980s,
        it experienced mixed fortunes domestically, as it went through a series of changes in corporate ownership with
        little or no experience in the restaurant business. In the early 1970s,
        KFC was sold to the spirits distributor Heublein, which was taken over by the R. J. Reynolds food and tobacco
        conglomerate; that company sold the chain to PepsiCo. The chain continued to expand overseas,
        however, and in 1987 it became the first Western restaurant chain to open in China. It has since expanded
        rapidly in China, which is now the company's single largest market. PepsiCo spun off its restaurants
        division as Tricon Global Restaurants, which later changed its name to Yum! Brands.

            KFC was founded by Colonel Harland Sanders, an entrepreneur who began selling fried chicken from his
            roadside
            restaurant in Corbin, Kentucky during the Great Depression. Sanders identified
            the potential of the restaurant franchising concept, and the first "Kentucky Fried Chicken" franchise opened
            in
            Utah in 1952. KFC popularized chicken in the fast food industry,
            diversifying the market by challenging the established dominance of the hamburger. By branding himself as
            "Colonel Sanders", Harland became a prominent figure of American cultural history,
            and his image remains widely used in KFC advertising. However, the company's rapid expansion overwhelmed the
            aging Sanders and he sold it to a group of investors led by
            John Y. Brown, Jr. and Jack C. Massey in 1964.

    <h2>Products</h2>
    <hr color="red">
    <p>KFC's original product is pressure-fried chicken pieces, seasoned with Sanders' signature recipe of "11 herbs and
        spices". The constituents of the recipe are a trade secret. Larger portions of fried chicken are served in a
        cardboard "bucket", which has become a feature of the chain since it was first introduced by franchisee Pete
        Harman in 1957. Since the early 1990s, KFC has expanded its menu to offer other chicken products such as chicken
        fillet sandwiches and wraps, as well as salads and side dishes such as French fries and coleslaw, desserts and
        soft drinks; the latter often supplied by PepsiCo. KFC is known for its slogans "It's Finger Lickin' Good!",
        "Nobody does chicken like KFC" and "So good".
